## Python Message Encode-Decode
### Secure your Information by Encoding the messages

Encoding is the process that transforms the text or information to the unrecognizable form and decryption is the process to convert the encrypted message into original form.

### Message Encode-Decode

Message encoding and decoding is the process to first convert the original text to the random and meaningless text called ciphertext. This process is called encoding. Decoding is the process to convert that ciphertext to the original text. This process is also called the Encryption-Decryption process.

### Message Encode-Decode Python Project

This objective of this project is to encode and decode messages using a common key. This project will be built using the Tkinter and base64 library.

In this project, users have to enter the message to encode or decode. Users have to select the mode to choose the encoding and decoding process. The same key must be used to process the encoding and decoding for the same message.

### Output
- Encoding

### Project Prerequisites

To build this project we will use basic concept of python, Tkinter, and base64 library.

- Tkinter is a standard GUI python library
- base64 module provides a function to encode the binary data to ASCII characters and decode that ASCII characters back to binary data.
